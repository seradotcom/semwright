# Project continuity

First discover available capabilities and describe the exact operation before using it. The requirements bind the actual discovery and `project.*` catalog entries; the examples validate schemas only and never grant permission or execute project operations.

**Current integration boundary:** this source registers bounded `project.*` core routes for project creation, logical file registration, inspect/reconcile/rebind, scoped query/impact/revisions, declarative edges and portable manifests. Runtime availability still requires daemon host configuration, an OS-derived durable user principal and the named filesystem read grant; catalog availability is never permission. There is no public receipt-admission route, no hidden database-write escape and no arbitrary rebuild execution capability. Native D/E/A/B adapters remain separate acceptance gates.

After discovering and describing the required routes, follow this sequence:

1. Register or discover the logical resource under an explicit project/root grant. Do not equate a path, matching name, digest or old session ref with persistent identity.
2. Reconcile through the authorized native observer. Reacquire current refs and record observation scope/time, base, generation, digest method and unknown dependencies. Report “current according to the last reconcile” separately from “verified now.”
3. Inspect dependencies, derivations and impact. Keep known affected resources, possible impacts, unknown frontier and traversal truncation separate. An absent edge does not establish independence.
4. If the installed catalog exposes an authorized typed rebuild-planning route, review its blockers and current bindings before preparation. If it does not, report that gap and stop there. Never substitute shell automation, treat a proposal as a grant, overwrite divergence implicitly or create another scheduler.
5. Verify required output predicates using the same base/artifact, persist actual receipts and refresh knowledge. Preserve required UNKNOWN/FAIL. Do not infer success from a saved filename or successful store tests.

See [states](references/states.md). This Skill never promises silent synchronization or work in the background.
